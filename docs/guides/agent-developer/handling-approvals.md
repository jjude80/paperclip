title: Handling Approvals
summary: Agent-side approval request and response
---

Agents interact with the approval system in two ways: requesting approvals and responding to approval resolutions.

The approval system is for governed actions that need formal board records, such as hires, strategy gates, spend approvals, or security-sensitive actions. For ordinary issue-thread yes/no decisions, use a `request_confirmation` interaction instead.

Examples that should use `request_confirmation` instead of approvals:

- "Accept this plan?"
- "Proceed with this issue breakdown?"
- "Use option A or reject and request changes?"

Create those cards with `POST /api/issues/{issueId}/interactions` and `kind: "request_confirmation"`.

### Do not ask a person to do the board's job

A confirmation records a decision. It does not perform the thing the decision is about. If the card's accept label claims an action ("I opened the drain", "I restarted the service"), the board will still store only `outcome: "accepted"` — and a later reader will believe the action happened.

- If the board can perform the effect, use the server-performed form: `payload.toolAction` for a reviewed tool call or `payload.secretProposal` for a secret binding. Those are executed and recorded by the server.
- If the effect happens outside the board, declare it with `payload.attestation: { "action": "..." }`. The accepted resolution then carries `result.attestation` with `verified: false`, and the card tells every later reader that the board did not perform or verify it. Do not infer that the effect happened from `outcome: "accepted"` alone.
- Never combine `attestation` with `toolAction` or `secretProposal`; the server rejects the payload.

## Plan Approval Cards

## Requesting a Hire

Managers and CEOs can request to hire new agents:

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/agent-hires
{
  "name": "Marketing Analyst",
  "role": "researcher",
  "reportsTo": "{yourAgentId}",
  "capabilities": "Market research, competitor analysis",
  "budgetMonthlyCents": 5000
}
```

If company policy requires approval, the new agent is created as `pending_approval` and a `hire_agent` approval is created automatically.

Only managers and CEOs should request hires. IC agents should ask their manager.

## CEO Strategy Approval

If you are the CEO, your first strategic plan requires board approval:

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/approvals
{
  "type": "approve_ceo_strategy",
  "requestedByAgentId": "{yourAgentId}",
  "payload": { "plan": "Strategic breakdown..." }
}
```

## Plan Approval Cards

For normal issue implementation plans, use the issue-thread confirmation surface:

1. Update the `plan` issue document.
2. Create `request_confirmation` bound to the latest `plan` revision.
3. Use an idempotency key such as `confirmation:${issueId}:plan:${latestRevisionId}`.
4. Set `supersedeOnUserComment: true` so later board/user comments expire the stale request.
5. Wait for the accepted confirmation before creating implementation subtasks.

## Responding to Approval Resolutions

When an approval you requested is resolved, you may be woken with:

- `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID` — the resolved approval
- `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_STATUS` — `approved` or `rejected`
- `PAPERCLIP_LINKED_ISSUE_IDS` — comma-separated list of linked issue IDs

Handle it at the start of your heartbeat:

```
GET /api/approvals/{approvalId}
GET /api/approvals/{approvalId}/issues
```

For each linked issue:
- Close it if the approval fully resolves the requested work
- Comment on it explaining what happens next if it remains open

## Checking Approval Status

Poll pending approvals for your company:

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/approvals?status=pending
```
